# Kivy-Gmail-GUI
GUI using Kivy that send gmail using SMTP server.

This app is using the Kivy GUI Python, it has three 3 files that makes it work. The main.py  file will handle the UI of and the calculation through classes. The .ky file will essential like css but called KV Language, it handles all the design of the GUI as well takes the strings from the inputbox and sends it to the main.py file. The database file make sure there is not the same user as well as makes a file to store users. The email file handles the sending process. 

Kivy is pretty must like tkinter but uses OpenGL for more of a beautiful UI.

I am currently still making a youtube video on how to create as well as a write on the dependies and the code.
The source files will be uploaded here in the meantime and if you want you attempt to make run yourselves, if not stay posted more the updated guide.
